<p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> Feb 27, 2026</p>

<p>
    These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the Markk Habit Tracker mobile application (“the App”).
    By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
    If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the App.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1. Use of the App</h2>

<p>
    Markk Habit Tracker is a habit tracking application designed to help users create,
    track, and manage personal habits.
</p>

<p>
    You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2. User Data and Cloud Backup</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Habit-related data entered into the App is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> by default.</li>
    <li>
        The App offers an optional cloud backup feature using Google Drive (Android)
        or iCloud (iOS). Google Drive backup requires signing in to your Google account
        and granting the necessary permissions. Authentication is handled securely by Google.
    </li>
    <li>Cloud backup is optional and must be explicitly enabled or triggered by you.</li>
    <li>Only you, as the account holder, can initiate deletion of your cloud backup using the in-app delete option.</li>
    <li>The developer does not have access to your cloud storage account and cannot access, modify, or delete your backup data.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Google or Apple account used for backup.</li>
    <li>Markk Habit Tracker does not require user registration or maintain user accounts on developer-controlled servers.</li>
    <li>We do not claim ownership over the data you create within the App.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    For more information on how data is handled, please refer to our
    <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>3. Subscriptions and In-App Purchases</h2>

<p>
    Markk Habit Tracker may offer optional premium features through subscriptions or one-time purchases.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Payments are processed by the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.</li>
    <li>Subscription pricing, billing cycles, renewals, and cancellations are managed by your app store account.</li>
    <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled before the renewal date.</li>
    <li>You can manage or cancel subscriptions through your app store settings.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Markk Habit Tracker uses <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage purchase and subscription entitlements.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4. Free Trial (If Applicable)</h2>

    If the App offers a free trial, the duration and conditions of the trial will be clearly
    disclosed within the App. If not canceled before the trial ends, the subscription will
    automatically convert to a paid plan according to the app store’s policies.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>

<p>
    All content, features, and functionality of the App, including but not limited to design,
    text, graphics, icons, logos, and software code, are the intellectual property of
    Markk Habit Tracker and its developer, unless otherwise stated.

<h2>7. Disclaimer</h2>

<p>
    Markk Habit Tracker is provided on an <strong>“as is”</strong> and <strong>“as available”</strong> basis.
</p>

<p>
    We do not guarantee that the App will be error-free, uninterrupted, or produce specific
    results. Markk Habit Tracker is a productivity tool and does not provide medical,
    psychological, financial, or professional advice.
</p>

<p>
    Cloud backup functionality depends on third-party services (Google Drive and iCloud).
    We do not guarantee the availability, reliability, or performance of these external services.
</p>

<p>
    The App may use analytics and crash reporting tools to monitor performance,
    diagnose technical issues, and improve reliability and user experience.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, Markk Habit Tracker and its developer
    shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages,

    cloud service interruptions, or device issues resulting from the use of the App.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>9. Termination</h2>

<p>
    We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to the App if you violate these Terms.
</p>

<p>
    You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it from your device.
    Uninstalling the App does not automatically delete cloud backups; deletion must be
    performed using the in-app delete option.
</p>

<hr />

    We may update these Terms from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page,
