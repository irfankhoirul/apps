<h1>Privacy Policy for Markk Habit Tracker</h1>
<p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> Feb 27, 2026</p>

<p>
    Markk Habit Tracker (“the App”) is a habit tracking application designed to help users build
    and maintain positive habits. This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected,
    used, stored, and protected when you use the App.
</p>

<p>
    By using Markk Habit Tracker, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance
    with this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<h2>1.1 Information You Provide</h2>
<p>
    Markk Habit Tracker allows you to create and manage habits. Habit-related data you enter
    into the App, such as habit names, schedules, and completion history, is stored
    <strong>locally on your device</strong> by default.
</p>

<p>
    The App offers an optional cloud backup feature. If you choose to use this feature,
    your habit data may be securely stored in your personal cloud storage account:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Google Drive</strong> (for Android users)</li>
    <li><strong>iCloud</strong> (for iOS users)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    To enable Google Drive backup on Android, you must sign in with your Google account and grant
    permission for the App to access your Drive storage for backup purposes. Authentication is
    handled securely by Google. The App does not access your Google account password or store your
    Google account credentials.
</p>

<p>
    Cloud backup is optional and is only performed when you explicitly enable or trigger it
    within the App. Backup data is stored in your own cloud account.
</p>

<p>
    We do not require account registration and do not directly collect personal information such as:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Phone number</li>
    <li>Contacts</li>
    <li>Precise location</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.2 Automatically Collected Information</h2>
<p>
    The App may collect limited, non-personal information automatically, including:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>App usage data (analytics)</li>
    <li>Crash reports and diagnostics</li>
    <li>Device information (such as operating system version)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This information is collected in anonymized or aggregated form and is used solely to improve
    app stability, performance, and user experience.
</p>

<h2>1.3 Purchase and Subscription Information</h2>
<p>
    Markk Habit Tracker offers optional in-app purchases and subscriptions. Purchase-related
    information is processed by third-party services and app stores. We do not have access to
    your full payment details.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Provide and maintain core app functionality</li>

    <li>Diagnose and fix technical issues</li>
    <li>Manage subscriptions and purchase entitlements</li>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>
    Markk Habit Tracker uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

    <li><strong>Google Play Store</strong> – for Android purchases and distribution</li>
    <li><strong>Apple App Store</strong> – for iOS purchases and distribution</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Cloud storage services operate under your personal account and are governed by their
    respective privacy policies.
</p>

<p>
    Other third-party libraries used in the App are limited to user interface,
    visualization, and core functionality purposes and do not independently collect
    personal data.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Habit data is stored locally on your device by default.</li>
    <li>If cloud backup is enabled, data is stored in your personal Google Drive or iCloud account.</li>
    <li>We take reasonable measures to protect your information.</li>
    <li>No method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Cloud backups remain fully under your control. Only you, as the account holder,
    can initiate deletion of your backup data.
</p>

<p>
    You may permanently delete your cloud backup at any time by using the
    delete backup option provided within the App.
</p>

<p>
    The developer does not have access to your cloud storage account and cannot
    access, modify, or delete your backup data.
</p>

<p>
    If you uninstall the App, locally stored data will be removed from your device.
